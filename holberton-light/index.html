                        Hitchcock is one of the undisputed pioneers of contemporary cinema. Countless genres
                        (first
                        and
                        foremost the thriller), but also directing techniques that his films helped popularize.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What Hitchcock is interested in is staging the common fears of the common man and making
                        the
                        viewer
                        experience them firsthand as he observes them. Dizziness, loss of identity, betrayal,
                        being
                        falsely
                        accused, claustrophobia, being suddenly torn from one's world, being hunted down:
                        Hitchcock's
                        cinema
                        arouses these feelings that are all faces of the same basic feeling, fear.
