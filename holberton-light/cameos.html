            <h1>Almost 39 cameos to discover</h1>
            <section>
                <p>Part of Hitchcock’s fame was due to the self-referential and often humorous appearances he made in 39
                    of his movies. The director usually appeared in the background as a pedestrian or a public
                    transportation passenger, and his walk-on parts eventually became so beloved that he had to place
                    them early in the film to avoid distracting his audience. One of the most creative cameos came in
                    the 1944 film “Lifeboat,” which takes place entirely on a raft adrift at sea. The portly Hitchcock
                    can be seen in the “before” and “after” photos in a newspaper ad for a weight loss product called
                    “Reduco Obesity Slayer.”</p>
