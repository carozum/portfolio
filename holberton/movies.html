    <p>Vertigo remains a timeless work, which penetrates deeply into your subconscious. It's a very
        dark film, a real nightmare, incredible from a technical point of view - in terms of music,
        editing, colors and rhythm. I'm not sure if the audience in 1958 (including me, since I
        discovered it at the age of 10) realized what was going on with this film then. Since then,
        every director who has dabbled in suspense has copied Hitchcock. In fact, anyone who has
        ever put together two takes of film has been inspired by it in some way."

    <p>"I had the opportunity to direct the last episode of the Alfred Hitchcock show for television in 1965. I was very
        young then. One day, Hitchcock came to the set to greet me. He held out his hand, which looked vaguely like a
        dead fish, and I told him how honored I was to meet him. He stared at me and said, "Mr. Friedkin, directors
        usually wear a tie." As for me, I was in a t-shirt and sneakers... Now, when I talk to film students, I usually
        tell them: "You don't have to go to school. Watch Hitchcock instead." Of all his films, I would say North by
        Northwest is the best, dealing with one of his favorite themes: a quid pro quo about who his character is."

    <p>"I really like the fact that Psycho was made with a small TV crew, in reaction to the Hollywood blockbusters of
        the time. Hitchcock wanted to be free with this film, and he made sure that was the case. The result is insanely
        modern - with its incredible structure, psychological depth, and detour of the narrative, when he decides to
        kill Janet Leigh's character. His incredible mastery on this film seems to me unsurpassed."
